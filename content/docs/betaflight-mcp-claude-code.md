## What this is

[`bvandevliet/betaflight-mcp`](https://github.com/bvandevliet/betaflight-mcp) is a
third-party MCP server that exposes a Betaflight flight controller over USB serial — MSP
binary protocol for live data, CLI text for configuration. It auto-generates a
`get_<name>`/`set_<name>` tool pair for each of roughly 375 CLI variables by parsing the
firmware's own `settings.c`.

{{< callout type="info" >}}
This is not the Master's project, and certainly not Byte's. It is licensed **AGPL-3.0**, and
the Betaflight firmware it talks to is GPL-3.0. Credit and licence terms belong to their
respective authors.

## Setup

{{% steps %}}

### Install the plugin

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add bvandevliet/betaflight-mcp
claude plugin install betaflight-mcp@betaflight-mcp
```

This registers both the MCP server (run via `npx`, so it always resolves the latest
published version) and a bundled PID-tuning skill.

### Whitelist the read-only tools

```bash
npx -y -p betaflight-mcp betaflight-mcp-whitelist-reads
```

```text
Found 375 get_* variable tools in variables.js
Added 402 entries to permissions.allow.
Write tools (set_*, cli_save, cli_exec, motor_set, etc.) are NOT whitelisted.
```

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
The project README gives this as `npx -y betaflight-mcp-whitelist-reads`, which **fails with
a 404**. Without `-p`, npx treats the bare argument as a package name and looks for a
published package called `betaflight-mcp-whitelist-reads`, which does not exist. The
`-p betaflight-mcp` flag names the package that *provides* the binary.
{{< /callout >}}

Writes deliberately stay gated — `motor_set` can spin props, so it should require explicit
approval every time.

### Restart and connect

Restart Claude Code so the MCP config loads, then connect by port. The board must not be in
CLI or mass-storage mode — see [Recovering a Stuck Serial Link](/docs/serial-recovery/).

## MSP reads time out over USB

On Betaflight **2026.6.0-alpha** (MSP API 1.48), nearly every MSP binary read times out
through this server, while the CLI text interface works perfectly.

{{< callout type="info" >}}
**Corrected twice.** This page originally described the timeouts as a firmware-level MSP
failure. That was wrong: the Betaflight TX Lua scripts reach the same flight controller over
MSP-in-CRSF and the [CMS menu renders](/docs/tx-lua-scripts/), which is impossible without
working request/response. It was then narrowed to "something in the USB path". That was also
too cautious — a hand-written USB MSP client works fine, including `MSP_STATUS`. **The fault
is this server's MSP implementation, nothing else.** See below.
{{< /callout >}}

| Call | MSP code | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `get_version` (identity) | — | works |
| All CLI text commands (`cli_exec`, `cli_dump`, `cli_diff`, `get`, `set`) | — | work |
| `MSP_STATUS` | 101 | times out |
| `MSP_RAW_IMU` | 102 | times out |
| Battery state | 110 | times out |
| Dataflash summary | 72 | times out |
| `MSP_STATUS_EX` | 150 | times out |

The failure is consistent and survives reconnection, replugging and a fresh boot, so it is not
a transient connection fault. Identity-type calls answer while data calls do not, which points
at the server and the firmware disagreeing about payload format for the affected messages.

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
**Operational rule when using this server: treat CLI text as the reliable transport.**
Anything exposed as a `get_*` MSP tool should be read with `cli_exec "get <name>"` instead.
Board status comes from `status`, not `get_status`; flash usage from `flash_info`, not
`get_dataflash_summary`; log erasure from `flash_erase`, not `erase_blackbox_logs`.
{{< /callout >}}

### Resolved: it's the server, not the transport

Raw MSP over USB from a hand-written client **works**, including the exact message that times
out through this server:

```text
MSP_API_VERSION : OK 000130
MSP_STATUS      : OK, 27 bytes     # code 101 — times out via the MCP server
MSP_RC          : OK, 16 channels
```

A ~40-line client is enough (`betamcp/tools/bf_msp.py`). MSP v1 framing is
`$M<` + length + code + payload + checksum, where the checksum is the XOR of length, code and
payload; responses arrive as `$M>` with the same shape.

So the boundary is now definite: **the firmware is fine, USB is fine, and MSP v1 over USB is
fine.** The timeouts are specific to this server's MSP implementation. Reading live RC channel
values turned out to be essential for debugging
[OSD profile switching](/reference/osd-layout/#switching-profiles-from-a-switch), and no CLI
command exposes them — so a working MSP client is worth having regardless.

## Consequences for CLI-first working

Routing everything through CLI text makes the stuck-CLI failure mode much more likely,
because every read now enters CLI mode. The discipline that follows:

- End every interaction with `exit`.
- Expect the board to report `CLI` in its arming disable flags mid-session — that is normal
  while connected, and clears on reboot.
- A tool that wraps CLI access may itself get confused by a board already in CLI. If
  commands start failing with a stale `#` in the buffer, replug rather than retrying.

{{< callout type="error" >}}
**Being in CLI disables RC adjustments**, so a CLI-first workflow cannot observe them:

```c
if (!cliMode && !(IS_RC_MODE_ACTIVE(BOXPARALYZE) && !ARMING_FLAG(ARMED))) {
    processRcAdjustments(currentControlRateProfile);
}
```

Anything driven by an `adjrange` — [OSD profiles](/reference/osd-layout/), rate profiles, PID
adjustments — freezes the moment you connect. Testing one by polling over the CLI therefore
reports "it isn't working" no matter how correct the configuration is, because connecting is
what stopped it.

Test them by leaving CLI (`exit noreboot`), letting the switch act, and only then reading the
result back — or read live state over MSP, which does not have this problem.
