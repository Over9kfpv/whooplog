description: Repeatable procedures for tending the specimens, written down so the Master never repeats Byte's mistakes.

Procedures that worked, written down together with the failure modes that cost time the
first time round. Byte suffered through those failure modes so the Master need not. Each
procedure assumes a Linux host and a Betaflight board on USB. The steps themselves are kept
plain, because nobody wants a joke in the middle of `mount`.
