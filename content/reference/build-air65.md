lead: The Master's second creature. Same board family, different gyro, different tune. Only the pilot settings are shared.

Added to the Laboratory on 12 September 2026. It is configured to match the
[existing craft](/reference/build-betafpvg473-v2-1s/) on everything a pilot feels, and left
at its factory settings on everything specific to its own frame and motors. The port itself
is recorded in the [setup log](/log/2026-09-12-air65-setup/).

## Flight controller

| Item | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Board target | `BETAFPVG473_V2` |
| Manufacturer ID | `BEFH` |
| MCU ID | `002900023235510535303333` |
| MCU | STM32G474, 168 MHz (PLLR-HSI) |
| Gyro / accelerometer | BMI270 (SPI, DMA, locked) |
| OSD | MAX7456, 30 × 13 characters |
| Onboard flash | 16 MB SPI (JEDEC `0x00852018`) — used for blackbox |
| Power | 1S |

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
Both craft report board target `BETAFPVG473_V2`, so the board name cannot tell them apart.
The **MCU ID** is the only reliable discriminator when a backup file turns up without
context. Crafty is `002700443235511330303938`.
{{< /callout >}}

Reported gyro rate in normal operation is ~3.2 kHz with a cycle time around 314 µs and
roughly 36% CPU load. That is lower than the other craft, which runs `pid_process_denom = 2`.

## Different gyro, different firmware

This board carries a **BMI270** where the other carries an ICM42622P. That is not a
variation this site chose — BETAFPV substitute IMUs as supply allows, and ship a matching
firmware build. See [Gyro Substitutions and Firmware](/reference/betafpv-gyro-firmware/)
before flashing anything.

## Motors and tune

| Item | Value |
| --- | --- |
| PID profile name | `GF 1219S` |
| Motor protocol | DShot300, bi-directional |
| Motor poles | 12 |
| `motor_idle` | 550 |
| `dyn_idle_min_rpm` | 30 |
| Board orientation | `align_board_yaw = -135` |

The PID profile, filter stack, board orientation and accelerometer calibration are the
factory values and were deliberately not copied from the other craft. They describe this
frame and these motors.

## Video

| Item | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Band / channel | Raceband 1 (5658 MHz) |
| `vcd_video_system` | `NTSC` |
| `osd_displayport_device` | `MAX7456` |

The two craft are kept on **different Raceband channels** on purpose — Crafty sits on
channel 3 (5732 MHz) — so both can be powered at once without a video clash.

## What is shared

These are pilot settings, not craft settings, and are identical on both airframes:

- [Aux modes and switches](/reference/aux-modes/) — the whole switch map
- [Actual rates](/reference/rates-actual/) — 170/550/0.35 roll and pitch, 120/400/0.25 yaw
- [Throttle curve](/reference/throttle-curve/) — 40/35/44 with an 80% scale limit
- [Crashflip](/reference/crashflip/) and the [OSD layout](/reference/osd-layout/)
