## Flight controller

| Item | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Board target | `BETAFPVG473_V2` |
| Manufacturer ID | `BEFH` |
| MCU | STM32G474, 168 MHz (PLLR-HSE) |
| Gyro / accelerometer | ICM42622P (SPI, DMA, locked) |
| OSD | MAX7456, 30 × 13 characters |
| Onboard flash | 16 MB SPI (JEDEC `0x00852018`) — used for blackbox |
| Detected buses | SPI × 1, I²C × 0 |
| Power | 1S |

Reported gyro rate in normal operation is ~8 kHz with a cycle time around 123–128 µs and
roughly 47% CPU load.

## Firmware

```text
Betaflight / STM32G47X (G473) 2026.6.0-alpha
MSP API: 1.48
```

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
This is an **alpha** build. Most MSP binary reads do not respond on it — see
[Driving Betaflight from Claude Code](/docs/betaflight-mcp-claude-code/) for the specific
message IDs that time out and why CLI text is the reliable transport here.

## What is not on this board

No GPS, no magnetometer, no barometer detected. This matters in two places:

- GPS Rescue is unavailable, so failsafe is a drop-or-land decision only.
- Blackbox logs contain **no location data**, which is why they are safe to share or
  discuss openly. A GPS-equipped craft would need home-point coordinates scrubbed before
  any log left the machine.

## Replacement board

A replacement was ordered on 18 September after a temperature warning that was never isolated
(see the [flight log entry](/log/2026-09-17-crafty-temperature-warning/)).

| Item | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Product | BETAFPV Matrix 5-in-1 V2 AIO, G473, 12 A, 1S |
| Retailer's name for it | `Matrix 1S Brushless Flight Controller (5IN1 II)` at most other shops |
| Status | On order; not yet on the bench |

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
Nothing above is verified against the hardware. The listing names a G473, but the reported target,
the gyro and the connector layout are unconfirmed until the board is connected. BETAFPV
substitutes gyros under the same target, so expect `ICM42622P` only if
[the gyro notes](/reference/betafpv-gyro-firmware/) say it is still shipping. Everything under
Flight controller above describes the **old** board until then.

## Known sensor issue

The current sensor on this board reports implausible values — see the
[flight log entry](/log/2026-09-08-post-rebuild-shakedown/) for a 1320 A reading that is an
ADC scaling artifact rather than a real event. Treat `amperage` columns in the blackbox
data as untrustworthy until `ibata_scale` and `ibata_offset` are recalibrated.
