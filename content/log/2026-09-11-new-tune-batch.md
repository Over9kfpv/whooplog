## Setup

First flights after [softening the rates](/reference/rates-actual/) — every log in this batch
reports `rc_expo 35,35,25`, so this is the clean after-half of the comparison against
[flights 007–031](/log/2026-09-09-twenty-five-flight-batch/). Around 7 minutes armed across 21
flights, nine of them long enough to analyse.

Pilot verdict on the rates: **flew nice**. Nothing in the data contradicts that — no
oscillation, no saturation, no tracking problems. The tune question is closed.

The battery question is not.

## The packs are degrading

Sag under load — the difference between resting voltage and loaded voltage *within the same
flight* — has risen sharply:

| Batch | Mean sag |
| --- | --- |
| 2026-09-09 (old tune) | **0.24 V** |
| 2026-09-11 (this batch) | **0.39 V** |

{{< callout type="error" >}}
The obvious confound points the **wrong way**. Mean peak throttle fell from **1505 to 1430**
between the two batches. Less throttle, more sag. That rules out "flying harder" and leaves
increased internal resistance — cells that have been damaged and no longer hold voltage under
load.
{{< /callout >}}

Which is consistent with the history: the previous batch recorded repeated discharges to
2.83–2.99 V, and deep discharge is precisely what raises a lithium cell's internal resistance.

## Consequences

| Flight | Duration | Min | End | Gap | Reading |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| btfl_002 | 93.8 s | 3.00 V | 3.16 V | 0.15 | Long flight, held up |
| btfl_005 | 46.9 s | **2.45 V** | 3.14 V | 0.69 | Severe sag, full recovery |
| btfl_008 | 41.6 s | **2.43 V** | 3.05 V | 0.62 | Severe sag, full recovery |
| btfl_010 | 25.6 s | 2.98 V | 3.02 V | 0.04 | Genuinely run down |
| btfl_011 | 43.4 s | **2.51 V** | 2.87 V | 0.36 | Severe sag |
| btfl_015 | 30.7 s | 2.95 V | 3.14 V | 0.19 | |
| btfl_016 | 21.2 s | **2.57 V** | 3.01 V | 0.44 | Severe sag |
| btfl_017 | 23.8 s | **2.58 V** | 2.97 V | 0.39 | Severe sag |
| btfl_019 | 33.8 s | **2.71 V** | 3.30 V | 0.59 | Severe sag, full recovery |

Eight of nine dipped below 3.00 V, against five of eight last time. Momentary minimums reached
**2.43 V**, well below the previous worst of 2.83 V.

But the *character* of the problem has changed. Last batch the concern was packs flown flat —
small min-to-end gaps meaning the low reading was the pack's real state. Here only `btfl_010`
fits that description. Everything else shows a large gap: the pack dives under throttle and
recovers once unloaded.

**Resting voltages at landing are mostly sensible** (2.87–3.30 V), so the landing decisions
have improved. The packs are simply no longer capable of delivering current without collapsing.

## The warning fix has a blind spot

[Setting `vbat_duration_for_critical = 2.0 s`](/reference/osd-layout/#why-the-low-voltage-warning-was-being-ignored)
was the right call for the problem as it stood — the alert fired on every throttle punch and
had become background noise.

It also means a dive to 2.43 V lasting under two seconds is **filtered out by design**. The
alarm is behaving exactly as configured and reporting nothing, while the cell takes damage.

The resolution is to stop treating the two thresholds as one problem:

- **Warning** stays at 2.0 s — "this pack is depleting", which is a slow condition and should
  ignore transient sag.
- **Critical** drops to **0.5 s** — "this is dangerous right now", which is a fast condition
  and must not be filtered away.

## Airframe

Motor eRPM-per-command spread ran 6.9–11.2 %, slightly wider than the previous batch's
5.3–10.0 %. Worth noting rather than worrying about: voltage sag itself affects motor
response, so a degrading pack inflates this figure without any mechanical fault. No
saturation; peak throttle never exceeded 1511 of 2000.

Yaw behaved normally, which answers the open question from the
[`adjrange` incident](/reference/aux-modes/) — `f_yaw` had been driven to 663 before being
restored to 120, and there is no sign of a lingering problem.

## The flash filled again

`usedSize` reached `totalSize` for the second batch running, so any flights after `btfl_021`
recorded nothing. The [live log-status element](/reference/osd-layout/#blackbox-log-number-on-screen)
now shows `>` when this happens, but the underlying habit needs to be erasing between sessions
rather than noticing afterwards.

## Open

- **Replace the packs.** The sag measurement is the strongest evidence yet; no configuration
  change recovers a cell with raised internal resistance.
- **Re-measure sag on a fresh pack.** If a new cell shows ~0.24 V again, that confirms
  degradation rather than something environmental.
- `ibata_scale` / `ibata_offset` still uncalibrated, so current draw remains unusable.

## Method

Decoded with [`blackbox_decode`](/docs/decode-and-analyze-blackbox/). Sag is the 90th
percentile of voltage at idle throttle minus the 10th percentile at the top 15 % of throttle,
computed within each flight so pack state and temperature are controlled for. Motor spread is
the range of per-motor mean `eRPM ÷ mean motor command` over samples above idle.
