# whooplog — working notes for Claude

Hugo + Hextra documentation site about two 1S FPV tinywhoops (Crafty and Air65). Deployed to GitHub Pages at
`https://over9kfpv.github.io/whooplog/`.

## Critical: the site lives on a subpath

`baseURL` is `https://over9kfpv.github.io/whooplog/` (trailing slash required). `hugo server`
preserves the path, so local dev runs at `http://localhost:1313/whooplog/`, not `/`. This is
deliberate — it means subpath bugs surface locally.

**Two rules for content:**

1. Never write raw HTML with root-absolute paths. `<img src="/x.png">` and
   `<a href="/docs/">` bypass Hextra's render hooks and 404 in production. Use markdown
   syntax instead — the hooks pass those through `relURL`. If raw HTML is unavoidable, use
   `{{ "x.png" | relURL }}`.
2. Never hardcode `/whooplog/...` in content either. That breaks `hugo server` and any
   future domain move. Write `/docs/...` and let the hook prepend the base.

Verify before pushing:

```bash
hugo --gc --minify --cleanDestinationDir --printPathWarnings
grep -ro 'href="/[a-z]' public --include=*.html | grep -v '/whooplog/'
grep -ro 'src="/[a-z]'  public --include=*.html | grep -v '/whooplog/'
```

Both greps must return nothing.

## Theme

Hextra, pinned as a git submodule at `themes/hextra` (tag `v0.12.1`). It ships **precompiled
Tailwind CSS and contains no SCSS**, so CI needs no Dart Sass and no `npm install` — Hugo
extended alone is enough. Don't add a dart-sass step; that advice comes from Hextra's
pre-0.10 SCSS era.

`markup.highlight.noClasses = false` is required — Hextra's chroma CSS is class-based, and
without it code blocks ignore the light/dark toggle.

Layouts map automatically by section: `/blog` gets the theme's blog layout, `/log` and
`/reference` fall through to the docs-style list layout with a sidebar. No `cascade` needed.

### Local theme override — `layouts/_partials/shortcodes/card.html`

Hextra v0.12.1 has a subpath bug in its `card` shortcode. It computes the href as
`($link | relURL)`, but **`relURL` does not prepend the baseURL path when its input already
starts with `/`** — it returns the string unchanged:

```text
"/reference/" | relURL                            → /reference/      ✗
relURL (strings.TrimPrefix "/" "/reference/")     → /whooplog/reference/  ✓
```

So `{{< card link="/reference/" >}}` emitted a link that 404s in production. The theme's own
`layouts/_markup/render-link.html` gets this right, which is why plain markdown links are
fine. We override just that one line. Re-check the override on every Hextra upgrade.

`layouts/_shortcodes/hextra/hero-button.html` has the **identical bug** upstream and is not
currently overridden — if you start using `hero-button` with a `/`-prefixed link, override
it the same way.

Run `npm run check:paths` after building; it fails the build on any root-absolute URL. Note
it must match unquoted attributes too, since `--minify` strips attribute quotes.

### Search

`params.search.flexsearch.tokenize = "full"` (not Hextra's `forward` default) so a search for
`srate` matches `roll_srate`. Forward tokenization only matches word *prefixes*, which is
wrong for a site whose main lookup target is CLI variable names.

Two output files are easy to confuse when debugging search:

- `public/js/flexsearch.<hash>.js` — the **vendored FlexSearch library**, fetched from
  jsDelivr at build time and copied local. Its hash never changes with your config; don't
  look here for your settings. Note the build needs network access to jsDelivr.
- `public/en.search.min.<hash>.js` — **your templated search code**, from
  `themes/hextra/assets/js/flexsearch.js` via `ExecuteAsTemplate`. Config values land here
  (`grep -o '"full"\|"forward"'` to confirm).

Hugo caches processed assets; `rm -rf resources/` if a config change seems not to apply.

## Blackbox log policy

Raw `.bbl`, decoded `.csv` and `.event` files are **gitignored**. Log pages carry the
analysis — tables, ratios, dB figures — and name their source file in frontmatter
(`log_file:`). `/docs/decode-and-analyze-blackbox/` documents the command that reproduces
the numbers from a local copy.

If committing logs ever becomes worthwhile, use **GitHub Release assets** — not Git LFS.
`actions/checkout` does not fetch LFS objects without `lfs: true`, so LFS would silently
deploy 130-byte pointer files in place of every log, and LFS bandwidth is quota-metered.

**Privacy:** this craft has no GPS, so its logs contain no location data. A GPS-equipped
craft would need home-point coordinates scrubbed before any log is committed to a public
repo.

## Content conventions

- YAML frontmatter in content; archetypes emit YAML too.
- Section pages: `title`, `description`, `lead`, `weight`, `toc`.
- `hugo new log/YYYY-MM-DD-name.md --kind log` gives the flight-log skeleton.
- Tone is reference voice, not diary. State findings as findings — "ratios ranged
  1.69–1.78, a spread under 5%", not "phew, it held up". First person only where an action
  was taken.
- Use callouts heavily: `warning` for traps, `error` for open issues, `info` for scope
  caveats. The site's value is largely in the gotchas.

## Two craft, one site

Since September 2026 the site covers **two airframes**, so every content page declares which
one it applies to:

```yaml
craft: ["Crafty", "Air65"]
```

`craft` is a Hugo taxonomy registered in `hugo.toml` alongside `tag`, so term pages generate
themselves at `/craft/crafty/` and `/craft/air65/`. Adding a third drone needs no
configuration, only frontmatter.

The split that matters:

- **Pilot settings** — switch map, rates, throttle curve, crashflip, OSD layout — are shared,
  and those pages carry both craft.
- **Craft settings** — PIDs, filters, `motor_idle`, `align_board_yaw`, `acc_calibration`,
  VTX frequency, and the two OSD **driver** variables — belong to one airframe and must
  never be copied between them.

Both boards report target `BETAFPVG473_V2`, so the board name does not identify a craft. Use
the MCU ID, or the gyro. Name a craft exactly as Betaflight reports `craft_name`, or the
taxonomy splits it in two.

Where a shared page has a per-craft exception, add a short `## On the Air65` section rather
than forking the page.

## Scope discipline

Everything documented is specific to one airframe on alpha firmware. Don't generalise
settings into recommendations. Third-party reference material (Betaflight wiki mirrors,
tuning transcripts bundled with the betaflight-mcp plugin) may be **cited and linked, never
copied** into `content/`.

## Bench and blog

This repo is the **public site**. Its private counterpart is `/home/hans/Projects/whoopshop`,
the bench workspace: it drives the flight controllers over USB (`tools/bf_cli.py`,
`tools/bf_msp.py`, `tools/blackbox_tool.py`), keeps raw logs in `logs/` and config backups in
`config/backups/`, and holds its own working journal in `content/log/`.

- Flow is one way: **bench → site**. The bench is the source of truth for settings and raw data;
  this site carries the analysis. Never edit the flight controller from here.
- "Update the whooplog" means updating this repo. Use the `port-bench-entry` skill
  (`.claude/skills/port-bench-entry/`) to find what the bench has that the site lacks and to
  translate it.
- Names differ between the two: the bench says `AIR65 F` / `AIR75 F`, the site says `Air65`
  and files the AIR75 F logs under `Crafty` (same board UID `…303938`).
- Log pages use `weight` to sort newest-first; adding one means renumbering the older ones.
- Anything that is a pilot setting (rates, switches, crashflip) must match the bench's
  `content/reference/pilot-preferences.md`. When one changes there, mirror it in `/reference`.

`/home/hans/Projects/betamcp` is a scratch workspace holding upstream clones (betaflight,
betaflight-configurator, betaflight-mcp, blackbox-log-viewer) and working log files. It is
not a git repo and contains no code of ours.
